        expressions of sentimnt will be simple!
        Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mMarseille the Shell> [0mHello! Are you a human searching for a couple hours of         entertainment and want an opinion from a lovely but admittedly idiotic         chatbot? If so, then you're in the right place! How can I best aid your         decision making process?
> I didn't like either "Titanic (1997)" or "Ex Machina".

[96mMarseille the Shell> [0mYou didn't like Titanic (1997). You didn't like Ex Machina (2015).  Keep rating movies for a recommendation!
